# Project2 - CS599

The project built on C language is intended to raycast mathematical primitives based on a scene input file (JSON format file)
into a pixel buffer in positive Z direction and then write the image output in P6 format to a ppm file. 

In the process of conversion the program will be able to handle undefined errors with a prefixed error message.
